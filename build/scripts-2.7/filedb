Usage:

  filedb <mountpoint> <db_uri> <collection>
  filedb (-h | --help)
  filedb --version

Options:
  -h --help     Show this screen.
  --version     Show version.

Help:
    Create a file that pretends to be a database. If you try to open the file, 
    it will JSONify the collection and dump it back to you.

    Files are simpler than databases and don't break. The database operations
    we need to perform aren't complicated and don't require high performance. By
    using files there isn't a database that can fail. There's the added benefit
    that if customers want to use different types of databases for distributed
    systems, we can plug into any of them using a `filedb` (we just have to make
    something that dumps out JSON.
